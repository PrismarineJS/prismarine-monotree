You are in a **monorepo** containing PrismarineJS projects, each stored as a Git subtree under `trees/`.

## Setup Environment

The workspace is usually setup for you ahead of time. If you need to reset it, run `bash ./install.sh`.
This will create trees if they don't exist, update them with latest upstreams and then use `bun` (for speed)
to install the deps. We use `--ignore-scripts` as there are some broken scripts in some deps, then manually
run what scripts need to be run.

ðŸ‘‰ Use node and npm for scripts (not Bun) â€” several projects assume Node.js compatibility.

ðŸ‘‰ Use `bun --ignore-scripts` for handling package deps (add/remove), but make sure to manually run needed post-install scripts (see below) if you get errors post install.

* `./install.sh` for reference includes:
```sh
node scripts/create-trees.js
node scripts/update-trees.js
# in root here
bun install --ignore-scripts
# manually run some scripts
npm --prefix trees/node-minecraft-data run prepare
npm --prefix trees/node-mojangson run prepublish
# manually fix some package issues wrt self `file:` deps
node scripts/make-links.js
```

## ðŸ“œ Project Notes

Most projects are Node.js, but not all. Check CI files, README.md or other markdown docs inside a tree:

```sh
ls -R trees/<project> | grep .md
```

Some projects (notably mineflayer, node-minecraft-protocol, bedrock-protocol) have very long test runs because they spin up servers for multiple Minecraft versions.

Instead of `npm test` prefer:
```sh
npm run pretest
npx mocha --exit -g "1.20v"
```

where 1.20 is the version to target.

To find supported versions:
* mineflayer/lib/version.js
* node-minecraft-protocol/src/version.js
* bedrock-protocol/src/options.js

For all other projects, these don't spawn servers so you can run full test suites without problems.

## Examples

Prompt: "Why are mineflayer tests failing?"

You:
```md
I need to locate the mineflayer repo, then test it.
> ls trees
Let me understand the project structure.
> cd trees/mineflayer && ls
> cat package.json
> ls -R test
OK, let's run the tests to see what the issues are.
> npm test
Looks like an issue with the mocha test suite on a test prefixed with version 1.20. Let me run mocha again directly for this test, with `--bail` to fail-fast.
> npx mocha --exit --bail -g "1.20v | tail -100
Looks like an issue with enchanting tables. The stack trace mentions prismarine-block and prismarine-item, so let me trace the code a bit.
> grep "enchant" lib
Let me also look at some workspace code for prismarine-block. Let me search it for some docs.
> ls -R ../prismarine-block | grep .md
Just a readme and API doc. Let me continue first, then if I get stuck I can look at the doc.
> grep "enchant" ../prismarine-block
Looks like an async issue! We need to await this call.
> sed ... 
Now let me try tests again.
> npx mocha --exit --bail -g "1.20v | tail -100
Great! Tests are passing.
```
